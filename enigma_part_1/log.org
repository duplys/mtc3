* challenge
** decrypt enigmaCipher1.txt
** the unknown key consists of
- the selection of the rotors
- the selection of the reflector
- initial position of each of the 3 rotors
- no stecker cables connected!
** example
- if rotors 0,1,2 and the reflector C are chosen ...
- and the initial position of the rotors is A,B,C then the wanted key is
- 012CABC
** the plaintext is english poetry
* enigma software
** usage: enigma.x rotors reflector init infile
** options
rotors    => LMR rotors (0 thru 4, no space, no repeats)
reflector => B or C
init      => initial position for LMR rotors (A thru Z, no space)
infile    => input file name

For example: Enigma 214 B XWA plain.txt
** test
The file ciphertext.txt contains the output generated by:

    Enigma 302 B WAG plaintext.txt

To decrypt, use

    Enigma 302 B WAG ciphertext.txt

As noted above, the files cannot contain anything but 
uppercase A thru Z. Be careful not to insert a newline
at the end of the file.
